	</div>

	<div class="poltext">
		<span class="str">Information right:</span><br/>
		You have the right at any time to request access to your personal data stored by us. This gives you the opportunity to check which personal data we process about you and that we use it in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.
	</div>

	<div class="poltext">
		<span class="str">Correction right:</span><br />
		You have the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data corrected and to be informed of the correction. We will inform the individual concerned of the adjustments made to any incorrect data, unless such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.

	</div>

	<div class="policy">
		6. Data security
	</div>

	<div class="poltext">
		We use suitable technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal data stored with us against manipulation, partial or complete loss and against unauthorised access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.
	</div>

	<div class="poltext">
		We also take internal company data protection very seriously. Our employees and all service providers that we retain are required to maintain a secrecy and to comply with applicable data protection legislation.  In addition, they are granted access to personal data only insofar as this is necessary for them to carry out their respective tasks or mandate.
	</div>

	<div class="policy">
		7. Data retention
	</div>

	<div class="poltext">
		We only save personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes as mentioned above. Contractual data, if available, will be retained longer by us as this is stipulated by statutory retention obligations. Retention obligations that require us to retain data result from accounting regulations and thus under fiscal law. In accordance with these provisions, business communication and concluded contracts are to be retained for up to 10 years. If we no longer require these data to carry out services for you, the data will be blocked. This means that the data may then only be used for accounting and tax purposes.

	<div class="poltext">
		If you have any questions regarding data protection, if you would like to receive information or exercise your rights, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:info@frizzyfoundation.org">info@frizzyfoundation.org</a>.
